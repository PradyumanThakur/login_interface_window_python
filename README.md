Login Interface Window

### Functionality

Default user is added with following Login credentials:
* email- johndoe1970@test.com
* password- test


		 * You can add multiple users by signing up.
		 * You can login into the system by providing email and password that was provided by you during signup process.
		 * sql_query.py is only used to create database and table.

*You cannot delete the user and update the current user information.*
These features are not added into this login system due to the laziness of the creator. Feel free if you aren't lazy enough to add these features.
